        <h1>Expected knowledge</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>basic pl/sql and distributed transactions with  using dblink</li>
          <li>basic knowledge of java and jdbc </li>
        </ol>        
        
        <h1>Expected infrastructure</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>Two oracle databases</li>
          <li>java version 6</li>          
        </ol>        
        <p>You can have one oracle database with two users (schemas).</p>
          
        <h1>Problem description</h1>   
        <p>
            We have pl/sql code, which has to be executed on several oracle servers. After each server has finished, the whole process has to be commited. This could be solved using dblinks. 
            Problem with such solution is:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>oracle session is single threaded -> we can't achieve paralelism</li>
          <li>dblinks locks table rows. Table rows in first database will be locked until last database has finished</li>
        </ol>   
        <h1>Summary of goals</h1>           
        <ol>            
            <li>accelerate execution with parallelism</li>
            <li>shorten locking times</li>
        </ol>    
        <p>Second solution is using java with threads. Using threads is not sufficient because we have to commit the whole thing only if pl/sql finished successfuly on all servers. To solve the problem we need a program which will: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>trigger execution of pl/sql code</li>
          <li>supervise execution and trigger commit at the end</li>
        </ol>        

        <h3>Data structure</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>List of servers</li>
          <li>Table to insert sample data</li>
          
        </ol>
        <h3>PL/SQL</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>PL/SQL Procedure to insert sample data</li>
            <li>Solution with dblinks</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Call PL/SQL procedure from java</h3>
        <h3>Use executor as triggering and supervising program</h3>
        <h3>Deploy java to oracle database server</h3>
        <h3>Extra benefits</h3>
